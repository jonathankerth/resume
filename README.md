If you're a recruiter or hiring manager, I encourage you to explore and get to know more about my journey in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out for any potential opportunities or collaborations.

## Download My Resume

To grab a copy of my resume:

- **Option 2**: Download it straight from [my portfolio](https://www.jonathankerth.com/Resume).

## Inspired by the design?

1. **Show Some Love**: Do me a favor? Please star this repo! üåü It means a lot to me.
2. **Make It Yours**: Instead of just downloading, why not make it a bit personal? Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
3. **Set It Up Locally**: Once you've forked it, you can pull it down and start making it your own.

\```bash

\```

4. **Personalize**: Go ahead and infuse your own story, style, and information.
5. **Share The Love**: If you decide to flaunt your version of the resume to the world, I'd appreciate a shoutout. Just a little line somewhere, saying:

Thank you for considering me for your team and respecting the work put into this project!
